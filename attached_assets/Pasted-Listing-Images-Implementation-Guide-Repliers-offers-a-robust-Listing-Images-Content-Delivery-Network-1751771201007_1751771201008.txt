Listing Images Implementation Guide
Repliers offers a robust Listing Images Content Delivery Network (CDN) that allows developers to embed and dynamically resize/format property photos seamlessly. This feature brings significant cost and time savings, enhances performance through shared caching, and mitigates the need for manual image monitoring.



CDN URL Structure


For listings with available images, an "images" array will be present. Here's an example listings array:



"images": [
                "area/IMG-N8418368_1.jpg",
                "area/IMG-N8418368_2.jpg",
                "area/IMG-N8418368_3.jpg",
                "area/IMG-N8418368_4.jpg",
                "area/IMG-N8418368_5.jpg",
                "area/IMG-N8418368_6.jpg",
                "area/IMG-N8418368_7.jpg",
                "area/IMG-N8418368_8.jpg",
                "area/IMG-N8418368_9.jpg",
                "area/IMG-N8418368_10.jpg",
                "area/IMG-N8418368_11.jpg",
                "area/IMG-N8418368_12.jpg",
                "area/IMG-N8418368_13.jpg",
                "area/IMG-N8418368_14.jpg",
                "area/IMG-N8418368_15.jpg"
          ],


The image URLs should be prefixed with https://cdn.repliers.io/. For example:



https://cdn.repliers.io/area/IMG-N8418368_15.jpg





Default Image Sizes


Mobile Devices: Image width defaults to a maximum of 800px.
Larger Screens: Image width defaults to a maximum of 1600px.


Default Image Formats


WEBP: Images will be returned in WEBP format if supported by the user's device.
JPG: If WEBP is not supported, images will be returned in JPG format.


Dynamic Image Resizing


You can dynamically resize images by appending a class parameter to the image request URL. Supported values are:



small: 400px width
medium: 800px width
large: 1600px width


Examples


For a small image (400px width):


https://cdn.repliers.io/IMG-E7312496_1.jpg?class=small



For a medium image (800px width):


https://cdn.repliers.io/IMG-E7312496_1.jpg?class=medium



For a large image (1600px width):


https://cdn.repliers.io/IMG-E7312496_1.jpg?class=large
