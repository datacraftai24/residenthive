## Executive Summary
The Boston real estate market presents a lucrative opportunity for rental income investment due to strong rent growth and low inventory. Despite a moderately high vacancy rate of 7.8% and a cap rate of 5.6%, the stable home prices and ongoing development projects hint at future growth potential. The investor's capital of $200,000 needs to be strategically leveraged with financing to acquire a property that aligns with the Buy & Hold Rental strategy, aiming for maximum returns.
