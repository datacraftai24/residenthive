## Description
Maximize property value by adding units through ADU construction, lot splitting, or ground-up development. This strategy creates value through development rather than just buying existing properties. Ideal for experienced investors who understand zoning, permitting, and construction.

## Requirements

- Understanding of local zoning laws
- Relationship with architects and contractors
- Ability to navigate permitting process
- Time for lengthy projects (12-24 months)
- Risk tolerance for regulatory delays

## Implementation Steps
1. Research local ADU laws and development opportunities
2. Find properties with development potential (large lots, R2/R3 zoning)
3. Conduct feasibility study with architect
4. Calculate development costs and projected rents
5. Secure construction financing or use cash
6. Obtain all necessary permits and approvals
7. Manage construction process closely
8. Market new units at premium rents
9. Refinance based on new income and value
10. Hold for cash flow or sell for development profit

## Scoring Weights
- Development potential: 35%
- Zoning favorability: 25%
- Location premium: 15%

- Exit options: 5%

## Best Markets
- Cities with new ADU-friendly laws
