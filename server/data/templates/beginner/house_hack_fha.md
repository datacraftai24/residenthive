## Description
Live in one unit while renting out other units or rooms, using FHA's low 3.5% down payment option. This strategy allows you to reduce or eliminate your housing costs while building equity and learning property management. Perfect for first-time investors who want to get started with minimal capital.

## Requirements
- Must be owner-occupied for at least 12 months
- Property must be FHA eligible (pass FHA inspection)
- Maximum 4 units allowed
- Good credit score (580+ for 3.5% down)
- Stable employment history (2+ years)
- Debt-to-income ratio under 43%
- Property must be primary residence

## Implementation Steps
1. Get pre-approved for FHA loan (find FHA-approved lender)
2. Calculate your budget (3.5% down + 2-3% closing costs)
3. Search for 2-4 unit properties in safe, rentable neighborhoods
4. Prioritize properties where other units' rent covers most of mortgage
5. Choose the least desirable unit for yourself to maximize rental income
6. Complete FHA required inspections and repairs
7. Move in within 60 days of closing
8. Screen tenants carefully (they will be your neighbors)
9. Set up separate business bank account for rental income
10. After 12 months, you can move out and rent all units

## Scoring Weights
- Number of rentable units: 30%
- School district quality: 20%
- Neighborhood safety: 20%
- Property condition: 15%
- Appreciation potential: 10%
- ADU potential: 5%

## Best Markets
- Near universities (steady student rental demand)
- Near hospitals (medical professionals and staff)
- Public transit accessible areas
- Up-and-coming neighborhoods with young professionals
- Areas with strong job growth

## Risks
- Living next to tenants can be challenging
- FHA loans have mortgage insurance premiums (MIP)
- Must maintain property to FHA standards
- Limited to one FHA loan at a time
- Tenant issues directly affect your living situation
- Higher interest rates than conventional loans
