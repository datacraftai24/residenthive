- timeToReturns: 6-9 months

## Description
Purchase distressed properties below market value, renovate them to increase value, rent them out for cash flow, then refinance to pull out your initial investment to repeat the process. This strategy allows you to build a portfolio with limited capital by recycling the same funds.

## Requirements
- Cash or hard money for initial purchase
- Renovation experience or reliable contractors
- Understanding of After Repair Value (ARV)
- Ability to manage renovation projects
- Good credit for refinancing
- Time for active project management

## Implementation Steps
1. Find distressed properties at 70% of ARV minus repair costs
2. Secure short-term financing (cash or hard money loan)
3. Purchase property quickly (cash offers win)
4. Create detailed renovation scope and budget
5. Complete renovations within 2-3 months
6. Rent property at market rate or above
7. Season the rental for 6 months (most lenders' requirement)
8. Order appraisal showing increased value
9. Refinance at 75% of new appraised value
10. Recover most or all initial investment for next deal

## Scoring Weights
- Purchase discount from ARV: 35%
- Renovation cost accuracy: 25%
- Rental demand in area: 20%
- Quality of location: 10%
- Exit strategy options: 10%

## Best Markets
- Blue-collar neighborhoods with steady employment
- Areas with dated housing stock
- Markets with strong rental demand
- Locations with rising property values
- Cities with available contractor labor

## Risks
- Renovation costs can exceed budget
- Appraisal may come in low
- Refinance terms may not recover full investment
- Holding costs during renovation
- Contractor delays or poor work
- Market shift during project timeline
