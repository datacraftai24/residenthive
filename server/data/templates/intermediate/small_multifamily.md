# Small Multi-Family Investment

## Metadata
- riskLevel: medium
- experience: intermediate
- timeCommitment: moderate
- timeToReturns: immediate
- occupancyRequired: none

## Description
Purchase a 2-4 unit property for maximum cash flow while still qualifying for residential financing. This strategy balances the benefits of multiple rental units with easier financing and management compared to larger apartment buildings. Perfect for scaling up from single-family rentals.

## Requirements
- 25% down payment for investment property
- Experience managing single-family rentals preferred
- Understanding of landlord-tenant laws
- Ability to handle multiple tenants
- Cash reserves for higher maintenance costs
- Time for more active management

## Implementation Steps
1. Analyze local multi-family inventory and cap rates
2. Get pre-approved for residential investment loan (up to 4 units)
3. Search for properties with separate utilities per unit
4. Calculate cash flow for each unit independently
5. Inspect all units and common areas thoroughly
6. Review all existing leases if property has tenants
7. Negotiate based on actual rents, not pro forma
8. Plan for unit improvements to increase rents
9. Implement professional property management systems
10. Consider value-add opportunities (laundry, storage, parking)

## Scoring Weights
- Cash flow per unit: 30%
- Location quality: 20%
- Condition of mechanicals: 20%
- Tenant quality: 15%
- Value-add potential: 10%
- Parking availability: 5%

## Best Markets

- Higher insurance costs
- More regulatory compliance required
