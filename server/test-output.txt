Given the constraints and the investor's beginner status, the focus was on cities that align with the budget, have manageable vacancy rates, and potential for rental income close to the target. None of the cities provided met the income goal with the available capital, as all had median property prices exceeding the budget or rental incomes significantly below the target. Therefore, no city could be ranked as likely to achieve the investor's goals.",
