# Multi-Agent Real Estate Investment System

## Architecture Overview

This system transforms our monolithic Virtual Real Estate Agent into a specialized multi-agent architecture for scalable, expert-driven real estate investment analysis.

**Philosophy: "Why use rules when we have LLMs?"** - The system now uses config-driven intelligence instead of hardcoded rules.

## ‚ö° NEW: Config-Driven Architecture (Implemented)

### ConfigRegistry System
Central configuration management with:
- **TTL Support**: Market data expires and auto-refreshes
- **Self-Learning**: Agents adjust source weights based on accuracy
- **Audit Trail**: Every config change is logged with who/when/why
- **Permission System**: Only authorized agents can update specific configs
- **Schema Validation**: Zod schemas ensure config integrity

### Dynamic Configuration Types
1. **Source Weights** (Self-adjusting trust scores)
2. **Metric Tolerances** (Acceptable variance thresholds)
3. **Market Data** (Mortgage rates, tax rates, etc.)
4. **Policy Rules** (FHA limits, DTI requirements)
5. **County Mappings** (Loan limits by location)

## üö® Critical Trust Killers (Must Fix Before External Demo)

### 1. Outlier Detection Bug
**Issue**: Trusted sources (Zillow, RentData) wrongly marked as outliers
**Impact**: Consensus drops to unrealistic values ($1,200 vs actual $1,650)
**Fix**: Weight-aware outlier detection that respects high-trust sources

### 2. Missing Loan Limits Validation
**Issue**: Not enforcing FHA/conforming caps
**Impact**: Suggests unaffordable properties
**Fix**: Integrate county loan limits into property validation

### 3. No DTI/DSCR Gates
**Issue**: Missing debt-to-income and debt-service coverage checks
**Impact**: Recommends financially impossible deals
**Fix**: Add DTI < 43% and DSCR > 1.2 validation

### 4. Stale Data Not Invalidated
**Issue**: Using 2022 data in 2024 analysis
**Impact**: Wildly inaccurate recommendations
**Fix**: Auto-invalidate data older than configurable threshold

### 5. Missing Cross-Sanity Checks
**Issue**: Allowing impossible rent/price ratios
**Impact**: $200 rent on $500K property
**Fix**: Enforce minimum 0.35% rent/price ratio

class FinancialCalculator:
    def calculate_total_economic_benefit(self, property_data, scenario):
        cash_flow = self.calculate_cash_flow(property_data, scenario)
        principal_paydown = self.calculate_principal_paydown(property_data, scenario)
        appreciation = self.calculate_appreciation(property_data)
        return cash_flow + principal_paydown + appreciation
```

5. **Stale Data**: Still using outdated information

## Deployment Readiness

### Internal MVP ‚úÖ Ready
- Architecture is solid
