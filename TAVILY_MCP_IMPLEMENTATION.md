# Tavily MCP Implementation Guide

## Overview
We successfully implemented Tavily MCP using OpenAI Agents SDK, allowing our LLM agents to autonomously research information without manual API calls.

## What is Tavily MCP?
Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows LLMs to directly call external tools. Tavily hosts an MCP server that OpenAI agents can use for web search and data extraction.

## Implementation Success
✅ **Working**: Strategy Builder Agent uses Tavily MCP to research:
- ADU requirements
- STR regulations  
- Section 8 payment standards
- Market-specific data

## How to Implement Tavily MCP

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install @openai/agents openai
```

### 2. Create an Agent with Tavily MCP
```typescript
import { Agent, hostedMcpTool, run } from '@openai/agents';

const agent = new Agent({
  name: 'Your Agent Name',
  model: 'gpt-4o',
  instructions: `Your agent instructions.
    Use Tavily to search for information when needed.`,
  tools: [
    hostedMcpTool({
      serverLabel: 'tavily',
      serverUrl: `https://mcp.tavily.com/mcp/?tavilyApiKey=${process.env.TAVILY_API_KEY}`,
      requireApproval: 'never' // Auto-approve searches
    }),
  ],
});
```

### 3. Run the Agent
```typescript
const result = await run(agent, 'Your prompt here');
```

## Key Benefits
1. **No Glue Code**: Agent handles searches automatically
2. **Dynamic Research**: LLM decides what to research
3. **Clean Architecture**: No manual API calls or parsing
4. **Autonomous**: Agent researches as needed during execution

## Working Example: Strategy Builder Agent
Location: `/server/ai-agents/strategy-builder-agent.ts`

The agent:
1. Receives market research data
2. Identifies gaps for specific strategies
3. Uses Tavily MCP to research (ADU rules, STR regulations, etc.)
4. Incorporates findings into strategy criteria

## Test Results
```
✅ ADU Strategy: Researched 9,000 sqft minimum lot requirement
✅ STR Strategy: Found restrictions in residential areas
✅ Section 8: Retrieved HUD payment standards
```

## Agents to Refactor with Tavily MCP

### Priority 1 (High Impact)
- [ ] **Property Hunter**: Research neighborhood specifics for each property
- [ ] **Financial Calculator**: Get current rates, insurance quotes
- [ ] **Market Scout**: Deep market analysis

### Priority 2 (Medium Impact)  
- [ ] **Research Coordinator**: Could use MCP instead of our research agent
- [ ] **Property Genius**: Property-specific insights
- [ ] **Deal Packager**: Market comparables

## Implementation Tips

### Do's
- Let the agent decide what to research
- Use clear instructions about when to search
- Include search context in prompts
- Trust the agent to find relevant data

### Don'ts
- Don't prescribe exact search queries
- Don't parse results manually
- Don't limit search capabilities
- Don't add approval requirements unless necessary

## Environment Setup
```bash
# Required environment variables
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_key
```

## Fallback Strategy
Always implement a fallback for when MCP fails:
```typescript
try {
  // Try with MCP
  const result = await run(agent, prompt);
} catch (error) {
  // Fallback to manual research
  const fallback = await manualResearch();
}
```

## Cost Considerations
- Tavily API calls are charged per search
- OpenAI Agents use tokens for reasoning
- Cache frequently searched data
- Batch similar searches when possible

## Future Enhancements
1. Add caching layer for common searches
2. Track MCP usage and costs
3. Build search result database
4. Create search templates for common queries

## Philosophy Alignment
This perfectly implements our core philosophy:
> "Why use rules when we have LLMs?"

The agent figures out:
- What information is missing
- What searches to perform
- How to incorporate findings
- When research is sufficient

No hardcoded rules, just intelligent agents making decisions.
