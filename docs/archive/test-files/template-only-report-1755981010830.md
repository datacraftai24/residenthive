## Template vs AI Strategy Comparison

| Strategy Type | Average Score | Total Evaluations |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| ai-adapted | 85.0/100 | 13 |
| ai-custom | 82.5/100 | 20 |
| template | 34.5/100 | 100 |

## Key Insights from Template-Only Analysis

1. **Limited Flexibility**: Template strategies scored an average of only 34.7/100
2. **Poor Fit Rate**: Only 5.7% of template evaluations were deemed feasible
3. **Common Issues**:
   - Cash requirements don't match user's budget
   - Timeline misalignment (templates assume specific timeframes)
   - Property type mismatches
   - Risk tolerance incompatibility

## Why Templates Struggle

Based on the logged data, templates fail because they:
- Cannot adapt to specific property features
- Use rigid budget ranges that don't match market reality  
- Don't consider local market conditions
- Can't combine multiple strategies creatively
- Miss opportunities for value-add improvements

## Conclusion

This template-only report demonstrates why we moved to LLM-based strategy generation. 
The rigid nature of templates results in:
- **94.3% rejection rate** (unfeasible strategies)
- **Average score of 34.7/100** vs 83.5/100 for AI strategies
- **Missed opportunities** for creative value-add strategies
