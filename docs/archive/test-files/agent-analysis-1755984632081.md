## 🎯 Overall Analysis

### 🚨 Critical Issues Found:

1. **Zero Expenses:** 95 decisions (70.9%)
2. **Unrealistic Income (>$15k/mo):** 0 decisions
3. **Missing Mortgage Calculations:** 94 decisions
4. **Unrealistic ROI (>200%):** 0 decisions

### 💡 Recommendations:

1. **Fix Financial Calculator:** Currently not calculating expenses (mortgage, tax, insurance)
2. **Add Market Validation:** Income projections need real rental comps
3. **Implement Sanity Checks:** Flag impossible numbers before presenting
4. **Use Real Interest Rates:** Current mortgage rates ~7-8% not being applied
5. **Add Property Tax Data:** MA property tax ~1.2% annually not included
